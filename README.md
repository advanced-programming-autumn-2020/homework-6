# homework-6
Write a C program that solves the all source shortest path problem by applying Dijkstra n = |V| times -- that is, once for each vertex
in the input graph G, as described in the recorded lectures. An important detail not described in typical dijkstra pseudo-code is the implementation of the next-closest vertex search. To get full credit, and to ensure the algorithm runs in reasonable time for the large input file provided, the search must be done using a binary min-heap priority queue. Rather than save all of the path data, output only the 100 longest paths encountered in the search as start vertex,end vertex,distance. Include a driver that tests the code on the two test graphs provided. Report the timings. No credit will be given for extremely inefficient implementations (several hours is the expected execution time for large graph). To speed up execution of the large graph, OpenMP is strongly recommended, but not required for full credit.
